    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Numeric : In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types in Numeric:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Integer : It contains positive or negative whole numbers without fraction or decimal. In Python there is no limit to how                  long an integer value can be. It is represented by int class.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Float : It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. It is represented by                float class\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Complex Numbers : It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example â€“ 2+3j. Complex number is represented by                        complex class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Sequence Type : In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types \n",
    "\n",
    "A) String : In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more                 characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. It is represented by str class.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) List : Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very                   flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type. It is represented by list class.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Tuple : Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is            that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by tuple class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Boolean : Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. It is represented by bool class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Dictionary\n",
